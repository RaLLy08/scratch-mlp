# Project Files Overview


- **nn.py**  
  Contains the implementation of a neural network built from scratch.

- **nn_extractor.py**  
  A decorator class that supplements the `NeuralNetwork` class with additional methods, such as extracting weights and other parameters.

- **draw_digit.py**  
  A script providing an interactive interface for predicting hand-drawn digit images in real-time.

- **mlp_training.ipynb**  
  A Jupyter notebook that explains the feedforward and backpropagation processes. It imports `nn.py` for training models and saving them using various datasets.

- **mnist_models_testing.ipynb**  
  A notebook used for testing pre-trained models on the MNIST dataset.

- **mlp_tf.py**  
  Tenserflow version


run **python draw_digit** to draw digits
